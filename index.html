                <p>I have a new passion for coding since September 2019. I am so excited to learn more because is very fascinating to see with your own eyes how an website or application is build in real time and also enjoyable and fun. Additionally because my Motto is: "A problem is a solution in disguise". I study along with <a href="https://www.udemy.com"target="_blank">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com"target="_blank">w3schools</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com"target="_blank">freecodecamp</a> in order to develop my skills.</p></td>
